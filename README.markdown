# Calculator service

This service implements a calculator service packaged in a webapp.

This project has been packaged using maven, as such it is needed to produce the build artifacts.

## Obtaining the WAR file

A simple `mvn package` will generate the .war file in the target/ folder.

## Running a stand-alone dev instance using tomcat

If maven is run with `mvn tomcat:run` goal, a server is started on localhost at port 13000 and the service is accessible (using a browser or cURL) at the following address:

http://localhost:13000/jaxrs-service/simplecalc/calculate/?formula=<your URL encoded formula>

## TBD

* An HTML client
* Support for decimal numbers (only integers work ATM)
* Better return codes
